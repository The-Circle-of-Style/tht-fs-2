# The Circle of Style: Technical Take-Home Test

Welcome to The Circle of Style's technical test. We're on a mission to revolutionize the pre-loved clothing scene, and we're eager to find skilled individuals who share our vision.

## Challenge Objective

You are tasked with developing a full-stack application with Node.js and React for ingesting user data via a CSV upload. We often deal with diverse data formats, so it's crucial to efficiently handle, format, and present such data.

### Detailed Requirements:

1. **Backend (Node.js)** We have provided you with a CSV file containing sample data. This data is semi-structured and contains variants of the same item.
You are expected to:
    * Identify and extract all key attributes from the dataset.
    * Normalise and format the data
    * Ingest the formatted data into a datastore of your choice - or store the data in-memory
    * Provide an API endpoint that serves the processed data.

2. **Frontend (React)**: The focus here is not on advanced UI/UX but to check basic integration skills.
Your solution should:
    * Fetch the processed data from the backend API.
    * Display the ingested items on a simple React front-end.

3. **General**:
    - Complement your code with clear inline documentation and a detailed README that explains setup and execution steps.
    - Highlight next steps and what you would do given more time.

## Evaluation Criteria:
We value simplicity, efficiency, and clarity. We'll be looking for:

- **Backend Competence**: Your API design and your ability to process and store data efficiently in-memory.
- **Frontend Presentation**: How effectively you retrieve and display data.
- **Code Quality & Readability**: We value code that's self-explanatory and clean. Proper naming conventions, modular design, and clear comments are key.
- **Documentation:** Your project should contain a concise README, detailing steps for setup and execution.

## Time Frame:

Aim to spend **6-8 hours** on this test. We're interested in how you tackle the task and manage your time.
Prioritize core functionality over additional features and provide a summary and plan for any features or enhancements you didn't have time to complete.

## Submission:

1. Commit your solution to a new public Git repository.
2. Share the repository link with us.
3. The README should be clear enough to guide someone unfamiliar with the project through the setup and execution process.

## Closing Note:

This test offers us a glimpse into your technical strengths and problem-solving mindset. The emphasis is on a functional, straightforward solution over a polished product. We're eager to see your unique approach.

Best of luck, and we're looking forward to your insights!
